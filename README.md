# NLU-datasets
Datasets for intent detection in languages used in the Baltic countries

This repository contains 3 datasets from Braun et al., which were machine-translated (and post-corrected) to ET, LT, LV, and RU. For more information, see [the paper about the original dataset](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-5522/) and [the datasets](https://github.com/sebischair/NLU-Evaluation-Corpora).

These datasets were used for measuring the intent detection accuracy in [this paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/10/5/161).
